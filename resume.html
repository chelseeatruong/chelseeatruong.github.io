            <b>The Future</b>
            <p>
                Although I haven't planned much about what comes after high schoool,
                I have always told myself I would go into college as a Biology 
                major. However, very recently I realized how closed off I was from
                other options that I might enjoy, which is why I chose to 
                take a computer science class! As I broaden my horizons, I hope
                to find something that I REALLY love and wouldn't mind doing
                for the rest of my life. <br>
                As of now, I'm currently taking an AP Biology class to get a 
                general idea of what I have planned so far for college.

                    One of the things I regret the most going into high school was
                    not being active in clubs! This year, I hope to change that 
                    as I have signed up for Red Cross and American Heart 
                    Association.
