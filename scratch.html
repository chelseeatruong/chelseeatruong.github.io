        <h3>What is Spoopy Maze?</h3>
        <p>
            Spoopy Maze is a game where a prince, that has been turned into a frog, 
            goes through mazes to save the princess that had been
            captured by a ghoul. The prince must go through the maze using the key
            arrows without touching the wall. 
            If he touches the wall, he will have to go back to where he started. 
            There will be flowers for the prince to collect to gain points.
            The flowers at the very end of each level will automatically switch 
            to the next level. In addition, there will be a time limit for 
            the player. The player must pass all levels to save the princess 
            before the time ends otherwise they will have to start over.

            Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this 
            unit that you applied in your game.
        </h3>
        <p>
        While learning different types of ways to program Spoopy Maze, I found that the if then structure was 
        an integral part of the functionalities of the game. Because it was based on avoiding
        hand-drawn black lines and touching a certain color to go onto the next level,
        we needed the if then structures to assure that if the lines were touched
        the player would have to restart at the initial position. We included an if then structure
        that stated if black, for example, was touched, our sprite would return to a fixed position 
        that it was in during the beginning the level. Furthermore, creating our own variable was
        another crucial part of completing the timer-dependent game to determine if the player
        has lost or won. We created our own timer that began at 45 seconds and decreased by 1 every second
        until it reached 0 which would then bring the player to a losing screen.

        <h3>Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, 
        how did you solve or overcome them?</h3>
        <p>
            Certain issues that were faced when creating Spoopy Maze was the inital lack of efficiency thus 
            causing a lot of confusion later on. At first, we had created many if then 
            scripts that were repetitive for all 3 levels. When we ran into an error in one of the scrips, it 
            took us a lot longer than it should have to identify the culprit. When realizing the problem,
            we began to condense the many scrips together to make it easier to read when solving minor problems.

        <h3>What aspects of your game do you like best?</h3>
        <p>Personally, I liked the story-telling aspect of Spoopy Maze. What I saw from a lot of other games
        was more arcade-like, requiring speed and skill. Our game, hoever, was a lot slower and 
        needed more reading. Although I did enjoy the quick pace of other games, it was nice that ours was calmer
        and more relaxing to play.</p>
        <h3>If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h3>
        <p>
         If I were given more time, I would shorten the tutorial. When reading the feedback, many people thought 
         that the tutorial took more time from the game than it should have. I would incorporate a script that
         allows players to left-click the screen to move onto the next part of the text instead of leaving the words
         on the screen for a certain amount of time. Also, I would fix errors towards the end of
         the game that occured due to the timer.
